<h1>Self Hosted Malware Analysis Lab</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
The malware analysis lab consists of a virtual environment hosted on VirtualBox, featuring two primary virtual machines (VMs): a Windows 10 VM running FLARE VM and a Linux VM running REMnux. This setup provides a comprehensive suite of tools for both static and dynamic malware analysis. The purpose is to provide a controlled and secure environment for analyzing malicious software, understanding its behavior, and developing mitigation strategies. This setup allows cybersecurity professionals to dissect malware, observe its impact, and gather critical insights without risking harm to production systems or networks.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>FlareVM</b> 
- <b>Remnux</b>
- <b>VirtualBox</b>
- <b>PowerShell</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>
STEP 1-Setting Up the Virtual Environment<br />
Install VirtualBox: Download and install VirtualBox from the official website. This will be your hypervisor for managing virtual machines (VMs).

<br />
<br />

STEP 2-
Create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine:

Open VirtualBox and click on "New" to create a new VM.
Choose a descriptive name for your VM (e.g., "MalwareAnalysis-Win10").
Select "Microsoft Windows" as the type and "Windows 10" as the version.
Allocate memory (RAM) for the VM. A minimum of 4GB is recommended.
Create a virtual hard disk. A dynamically allocated disk of at least 50GB is suggested.
<br />
<br />
STEP 3-
Install Windows 10:

Start the newly created VM and follow the prompts to install Windows 10 using an ISO file.
Once Windows 10 is installed, complete the initial setup and ensure the system is fully updated.
<br />
<br />
STEP 4- Disable Microsft Defender:<br />
Start off by disabling all Microsft Defender settings and then move on to the group policy settings afterwards.
<br />
<br />
STEP 5-Install FLARE VM:<br />

- FLARE VM is a Windows-based security distribution for malware analysis, reverse engineering, and incident response.

- Open PowerShell as an administrator in the Windows 10 VM.

- Execute the following command to start the FLARE VM installation:

- powershell
Copy code
iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://aka.ms/flarevm')
Follow the installation prompts. This process may take some time as it installs various tools and dependencies.
<br />
<br />
STEP 6-nstall REMnux:<br />

- REMnux is a Linux-based toolkit for reverse engineering and analyzing malicious software.
- To keep things organized, it's a good idea to set up a separate VM for REMnux.
- Create a new VM in VirtualBox, this time selecting "Linux" as the type and "Ubuntu (64-bit)" as the version.
- Allocate appropriate resources and create a virtual hard disk as before.
- Download the REMnux virtual appliance from the official REMnux website and import it into VirtualBox.
- Follow the prompts to complete the setup of REMnux.
  <br />
  <br />
  STEP 7- Setup and test VM connection:<br />
 - In windows powerShell run Ipconfig command to ping 10.0.0.3 connection
 - In the Remnux run Ping 10.0.0.3 to test a successful connection
